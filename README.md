# Cryptography
This is a repo I used for Computer Network Security assignment
It has a simple POC implementation of the three Symmetric Encryption algorithms, AES, DES, and 3DES
## Steps:
- Enter a secret key and the message on the text area provided
- Choose the type of Encryption Algorithm
- Then, choose if you want to Encrypt or decrypt the message entered, by the key provided
- Then press the button at the bottom left
- Finally, the output will be displayed on the textarea on the right
- Verify by copying the encrypted message and decrypting it with the same key 
  
You can use the link [SymmetricCryptography](https://symmetriccrypto.netlify.app) to try it out, or just open `index.html` in a browser.
